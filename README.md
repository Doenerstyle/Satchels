# Satchels

This mod adds **pouches** and **satchels**, which act as wearable inventory upgrades. Unlike your typical backpack mod, it's seamlessly integrated into the inventory screen instead of being on a separate screen.

## Pouches

A pouch adds 3 slots to your inventory, and can be worn on the left or the right side. You only need some leather and some string to craft it. Its capacity can be increased with **pouch upgrades**, which can only be found inside dungeon chests. Each upgrade will add an additional slot to the pouch's capacity, with the maximum being 8 slots. You can wear up to 2 pouches at the same time.

## Satchel

A satchel adds an entire row (9 slots) of storage to your inventory. But its utility is matched by its cost: crafting it requires a full diamond block. You can only wear 1 satchel at a time.

## Models

The items you wear will show up as 3D models on the player. This can be disabled in the config.
